## To Use this example

1. In environment.ts/environment.prod.ts you will need to add your tenant and clientId values.
Tenant will be the id of your organisation that is registered on azure.
ClientId is the id that you will receive when registering an application on azure.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
